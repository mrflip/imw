#
# h2. etc/directories.yaml -- specifies directory structure
#
# == Overview
#
# As data and datasets are being processed, files are created and must
# be stored in some fixed directory structure. This configuration file
# describes how internal IMW directory names are mapped to real
# directories in a local or remote filesystem(s).
#
# == Specifying directories
#
# Directories can be specified by workflow step (ripd, xtrd, etc.) or
# by particular category in a taxonomy.
#
# A leading '/' in a directory path causes the directory to be resolve
# relative the root of the local filesystem while the absence of such
# a leading '/' causes the directory to be resolved with respect to
# the $IMW_ROOT.
#
# Directories can be specified with a protocol like
# "ftp:user@host:dir" or "ssh:user@host:dir" (include the quotation
# marks around the entry to avoid the colons being interpreted by
# YAML) if they are on remote machines.
#
# To specify that a particular category in a taxonomy (and all its
# children) be stored in a special directory, use a hash pair under
# the "taxonomy" heading with a key given in the format
# "category/subcat/subsubcat/.../" and a path as specified above.
