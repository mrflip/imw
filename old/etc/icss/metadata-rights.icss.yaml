  statement:        |
      Information contributed to infochimps.org is and will always be free and
      open. This statement applies to this metadata and not necessarily to the
      dataset itself.
      
      Curation data (aka metadata) -- descriptions and information about
      datasets, such as what you are reading now -- is available under a
      "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ license.
      Among other things, this means if you use an infochimps.org
      metadataset, you should give us credit (but not in any way that
      suggests that we endorse you or your use of the work), something like:

      bq. Data from infochimps.org (http://infochimps.org), including
          contributions from [list the contributors given in the
          credits: section of each metadataset you use]

      Rather than list all the contributors, you may give a clickable link
      to a listing of contributors or to each metadataset's credits page.

      The datasets themselves bear whatever rights and restrictions are
      imposed by its source.  Infochimps.org will never add to and will
      never subtract from these rights and restrictions.  See the rights
      statement, if any, in the metadataset, and if in doubt contact the
      data source directly.

      We encourage everyone to be responsible, neighborly and generous:
      respect the wishes of those who have done the hard work to gather
      interesting datasets, acknowledge the contributions of others, and
      share.
