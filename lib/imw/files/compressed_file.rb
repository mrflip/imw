# h2. lib/imw/files/compressed_file.rb -- class describing compressed files
#
# == About
#
# Compression of files is handled via the
# <tt>IMW::Files::Compressible</tt> module which can be included by
# any object that has a <tt>@path</tt> attribute.  The methods defined
# there compress files and return this
# <tt>IMW::Files::CompressedFile</tt> object which has methods for
# decompression.
#
# A subclass of this class must define a +compression+ instance
# variable which is a hash with the following keys:
#
# <tt>:program</tt>:: a symbol naming the program used for
# compression/decompression which must be one of the symbols in
# <tt>IMW::EXTERNAL_PROGRAMS</tt>
#
# <tt>:decompression_flags</tt>:: a string of flags to pass to the
# compression program when decompressing the file.
#
# A subclass must also define the method +decompressed_path+ which
# returns the path of the file post-decompression.
