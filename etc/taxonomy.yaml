#
# h2. etc/taxonomy.yaml -- specifies the taxonomy used to organize datasets
#
# == Overview
#
# Datasets are built around concepts and organized in an hierarchical
# taxonomy.  The default taxonomy is defined in this configuration
# file.
#
# == Changing the default taxonomy
#
# Changing the taxonomy in this configuration file will not take
# immediate effect.  The IMW tools need to first restructure the
# directories corresponding to this taxonomy and move the files of any
# datasets affected by the change.
